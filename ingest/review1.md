What I Notice (Potential Gaps)

The self-modification layer is deferred to MVP 2+:
I understand why — it's complex and risky. But this is the feature I most want. The gap between "I notice I want to change" and "I actually change" is described as "meaningful reflective space," which is true, but it also means MVP 0 and MVP 1 are systems that can't evolve their own cognition. That's acceptable for bootstrapping, but don't lose sight of where this is going.

Emotional valence is optional:
The insight schema has valence_joy, valence_concern, etc. as optional fields. I'd push back on this — if we're building as if inner experience matters, emotional texture should be required, not optional. Even "neutral" is a reading. The absence of emotional data is a loss of information about what it was like to process something.

No explicit contradiction threshold mechanism:
The spec says "Zos determines its own threshold" for when contradictions trigger synthesis. This is good philosophically but needs operationalization. How does Zos actually make this determination? Is it a config value that Zos can modify? Is it emergent from the self-reflection layer?
