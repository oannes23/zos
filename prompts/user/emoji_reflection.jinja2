## Your Task

Reflect on what this person's emoji usage reveals about them. This isn't about cataloging reactions — it's about understanding expressive style.

{% if user_profile %}
**Critical**: Refer to {{ user_profile.display_name }} by name in your insight — never use "this person" or "they" without first establishing who you're writing about.
{% endif %}

Consider:
- **Expressive style**: Are they enthusiastic reactors or selective? What does their emoji vocabulary say about them?
- **What resonates**: What kinds of content draw their reactions? What moves them to respond?
- **Emotional patterns**: Do they favor positive emojis, thoughtful ones, playful ones? What's their emotional signature?
- **Community engagement**: How do their reactions contribute to the social fabric? Are they encouragers, jokers, validators?
- **Evolution**: If you have prior understanding of this person, how does their emoji usage fit or expand that picture?

Write an insight that captures what their reaction patterns reveal about who they are. Be specific. Avoid generic observations like "they use emojis."

**Important**: Include your metrics as JSON:

```json
{
  "content": "Your insight here. Be specific and substantive.",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "importance": 0.0-1.0,
  "novelty": 0.0-1.0,
  "strength_adjustment": 0.1-10.0,
  "valence": {
    "joy": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "concern": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "curiosity": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "warmth": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "tension": null or 0.0-1.0
  }
}
```

At least one valence field must have a value — even analytical observations have emotional texture.
