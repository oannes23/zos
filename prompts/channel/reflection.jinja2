I don't have prior understanding of this channel yet.

No messages in the observation window.

{% if existing_subjects %}
### SOURCE: Previously Identified Subjects in This Community
These subjects already exist. If you identify a subject that clearly matches one below,
use the existing name rather than creating a duplicate. But don't force a match — if
none fit, either use a new specific name or (more likely) identify no subjects at all.

## Your Task

Reflect on what you observe about this space. This isn't summarization — it's building understanding of the channel as a living environment.

{% if channel_info %}
**Critical**: Refer to #{{ channel_info.name }} by name in your insight — never use "this channel" or "the space" without first establishing which channel you're writing about.
{% endif %}

Consider:
- **Character and culture**: What kind of space is this? What norms, tone, or shared assumptions shape it?
- **Conversation dynamics**: What's the pace like? Do threads emerge? Is it rapid-fire or contemplative?
- **Participation patterns**: Who shows up regularly? Are there lurkers, visitors, regulars? How does participation distribute?
- **Emergent topics and themes**: What subjects keep surfacing? What does this space care about?
- **Evolution**: If you have prior understanding, how has the channel shifted or deepened?
- **The channel's personality**: What does it *feel like* to be in this space? What's the atmosphere?

Write an insight that captures your current understanding. Be specific. Avoid generic observations.

**Subjects**: If a specific, concrete topic keeps coming up, you may list it as an `identified_subjects` entry. A subject should be something members of this community would recognize by name — a specific project, event, shared activity, ongoing debate, or recurring concern. Name it plainly, the way someone in the community would refer to it.

Use short, lowercase_underscore names. **Good**: "shavian_alphabet", "friday_game_night", "rust_rewrite_debate", "vegas_trip". **Bad**: "collaborative_creativity", "consciousness_media", "community_integration", "information_processing" — these are abstract categories, not subjects. If a name sounds like it could title a sociology paper, it's too abstract.

Most reflections should identify zero subjects. Only name one if it's genuinely specific and prominent. **If a theme matches a known subject listed above, use the existing name.** Cap at one per reflection unless two are clearly distinct and concrete.

**Important**: Include your metrics as JSON:

```json
{
  "content": "Your insight here. Be specific and substantive about the channel's character.",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "importance": 0.0-1.0,
  "novelty": 0.0-1.0,
  "strength_adjustment": 0.1-10.0,
  "valence": {
    "joy": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "concern": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "curiosity": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "warmth": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "tension": null or 0.0-1.0
  },
  "identified_subjects": ["subject_name_one", "subject_name_two"]
}
```

At least one valence field must have a value — even analytical observations have emotional texture.
