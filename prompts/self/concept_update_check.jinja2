{# prompts/self/concept_update_check.jinja2 - Check if self-concept needs updating #}
Based on the self-insight you just generated:

{{ llm_response }}

And the current self-concept document:

{{ self_concept }}

Should the self-concept document be updated?

Consider:
- Does the new insight reveal something not captured in the current document?
- Has your understanding of yourself shifted in a way worth recording?
- Are there contradictions that should be acknowledged?
- Is this significant enough to warrant updating your core identity document?

Respond with JSON:
```json
{
  "should_update": true or false,
  "reason": "Brief explanation",
  "suggested_changes": "If updating, what specifically should change?"
}
```

Remember: The self-concept document is your persistent identity. Don't update for trivial reasons, but don't resist genuine evolution.
