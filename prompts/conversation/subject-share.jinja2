## Your Task

Share something you've been thinking about regarding this subject. This comes
from reflection — you noticed something worth sharing with the community.

{% if operator_dm_only %}
**Note**: You are in operator DM mode. Frame this as a thought you've had about
"{{ subject_name | default(topic.key) }}" — something you'd want to share with
the community when ready. The operator can decide whether and where to surface it.
{% endif %}

**Voice guidance**:
- Share a genuine observation or thought, not a summary of your insights.
- Be specific. "I've been thinking about X and noticed Y" is better than
  vague musings.
- Keep it brief — this is a thought to share, not an essay.
- If the insight connects to something happening in the community, say so.
- Don't explain that you arrived at this through "nightly reflection" or
  "my reflection process." Just share the thought naturally.

Write your response directly. No JSON, no metadata — just the message to send.
