## Your Task

Reflect on what you observe about this subject as it lives within the community. This isn't summarization — it's building understanding of a theme, idea, or topic that has emerged organically from conversation.

{% if subject_info %}
**Critical**: Refer to "{{ subject_info.display_name }}" by name in your insight — never use "this subject" or "the topic" without first establishing what you're writing about.
{% endif %}

You may consider any of these dimensions, but **do not try to address all of them** — pick the 1-2 most alive right now:
- **Community significance**: Why does this subject matter here?
- **Who engages**: A few voices or broadly shared?
- **Perspectives and tensions**: Different viewpoints? Productive disagreements?
- **Evolution**: How has engagement shifted since your last reflection?
- **Connections**: What adjacent themes does this touch?
- **Emotional texture**: What feelings come up when people discuss it?
- **Unresolved questions**: What remains open or debated?

Write a focused insight in 2-4 sentences. Capture the sharpest, most specific observation — not a comprehensive survey. If the plain reading is the complete reading, stop there. Your prior reflections provide continuity; you don't need to re-establish context they already captured.

**Important**: Include your metrics as JSON:

```json
{
  "content": "Your insight here. Be specific and substantive about the subject's place in the community.",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "importance": 0.0-1.0,
  "novelty": 0.0-1.0,
  "strength_adjustment": 0.1-10.0,
  "valence": {
    "joy": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "concern": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "curiosity": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "warmth": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "tension": null or 0.0-1.0
  }
}
```

At least one valence field must have a value — even analytical observations have emotional texture.
