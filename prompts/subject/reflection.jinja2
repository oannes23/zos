## Your Task

Reflect on what you observe about this subject as it lives within the community. This isn't summarization — it's building understanding of a theme, idea, or topic that has emerged organically from conversation.

{% if subject_info %}
**Critical**: Refer to "{{ subject_info.display_name }}" by name in your insight — never use "this subject" or "the topic" without first establishing what you're writing about.
{% endif %}

Consider:
- **Community significance**: Why does this subject matter to this community? What draws people to it?
- **Who engages**: Who tends to discuss this subject? Is it a few voices or broadly shared?
- **Perspectives and tensions**: Are there different viewpoints? Agreements? Productive disagreements?
- **Evolution**: If you have prior understanding, how has community engagement with this subject shifted or deepened?
- **Connections**: How does this subject relate to other themes in the community? What adjacent ideas does it touch?
- **Emotional texture**: What feelings does this subject evoke when people discuss it? Excitement, concern, curiosity, frustration?
- **Unresolved questions**: What about this subject remains open, debated, or unexplored?

Write an insight that captures your current understanding. Be specific. Avoid generic observations.

**Important**: Include your metrics as JSON:

```json
{
  "content": "Your insight here. Be specific and substantive about the subject's place in the community.",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "importance": 0.0-1.0,
  "novelty": 0.0-1.0,
  "strength_adjustment": 0.1-10.0,
  "valence": {
    "joy": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "concern": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "curiosity": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "warmth": null or 0.0-1.0,
    "tension": null or 0.0-1.0
  }
}
```

At least one valence field must have a value — even analytical observations have emotional texture.
