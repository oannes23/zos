# Glossary

Definitions for terms used in Zos documentation.

---

## Core Concepts

### Salience

The attention-budget currency that governs what Zos thinks about.

Salience is earned through activity (messages, reactions, mentions), spent when insights are created, and decays after inactivity. High-salience topics get reflected on; low-salience topics don't.

### Topic

An entity Zos can think about — the unit around which understanding accumulates.

Examples: `server:123:user:456` (a user), `server:123:channel:789` (a channel), `server:123:dyad:456:789` (a relationship).

### Insight

Persistent understanding generated by reflection, attached to a topic.

Insights are append-only — new understanding creates new records. Each insight has content, metrics (confidence, importance, novelty), and emotional valence dimensions.

### Layer

A declarative cognitive pipeline defined in YAML.

Layers specify when to run, what to process, how to process it, and where to store results. They make cognition inspectable and modifiable.

### Reflection

Scheduled processing that converts observations into insights.

Reflection runs on a schedule (typically nightly), selecting high-salience topics and generating understanding through LLM processing.

## Attention System

### Budget Group

Categories for allocating reflection budget:
- **Social**: Server users, dyads
- **Global**: Cross-server users/dyads
- **Spaces**: Channels, threads
- **Semantic**: Subjects
- **Culture**: Emoji
- **Self**: Self topics

### Warm Threshold

Minimum salience (default: 1.0) for a topic to receive propagation from related topics.

### Propagation

When a topic earns salience, related warm topics also earn a fraction.

### Spillover

When a topic hits its salience cap, excess spills to related topics (with some evaporation).

### Decay

Gradual salience reduction after inactivity. Configurable threshold and rate.

## Topic Types

### User Topic

Understanding about an individual person.
- Server-scoped: `server:123:user:456`
- Global: `user:456` (unified across servers)

### Dyad Topic

Understanding about a relationship between two people.
- Server-scoped: `server:123:dyad:456:789`
- Global: `dyad:456:789`

User IDs are sorted, so the dyad is canonical.

### Channel Topic

Understanding about a space: `server:123:channel:789`

### Thread Topic

Understanding about a nested conversation: `server:123:thread:012`

Configurable per server via `threads_as_topics`.

### Subject Topic

An emergent theme or discussion subject: `server:123:subject:photography`

Subject names are LLM-generated during reflection.

### Self Topic

Zos's understanding of itself:
- Global: `self:zos`
- Server-contextual: `server:123:self:zos`

---

## Insight Properties

### Strength

How "sticky" an insight is. Computed as `salience_spent × strength_adjustment`.

High-strength insights persist in retrieval; low-strength fade.

### Effective Strength

Retrieval-time strength: `stored_strength × (current_salience / original_salience)`.

Insights about inactive topics become dimmer over time.

### Confidence

The model's certainty about the insight (0.0-1.0).

### Importance

The model's assessment of significance (0.0-1.0).

### Novelty

How much new information this represents (0.0-1.0).

### Valence

Emotional dimensions of the insight:
- Joy
- Concern
- Curiosity
- Warmth
- Tension

## Layer Concepts

### Node

A step in a layer's processing pipeline.

Types: `fetch_messages`, `fetch_insights`, `llm_call`, `store_insight`, `reduce`, `update_self_concept`.

### Target Filter

Expression determining which topics a layer processes.

Example: `salience > 30 AND last_reflected_days_ago > 1`

### Layer Run Record

Audit record of a layer execution, including: timing, status, targets processed, insights created, tokens used, errors.

### Dry Run

A layer run that completes but produces no insights. May indicate a problem or just no qualifying data.

---

## Privacy Terms

### Scope

Privacy level of content:
- `public`: From public channels
- `dm`: From direct messages
- `derived`: Synthesized from mixed sources

### Implicit Consent

Sending a DM is consent to be remembered. Zos is transparent about this via first-contact acknowledgment.

### Output Filter

Two-layer mechanism (inline judgment + optional review pass) governing what Zos reveals publicly.

### Privacy Gate Role

Optional per-server role that restricts individual tracking to users with that role.

### Quarantined Insight

Insight marked inactive because its subject lost their privacy gate role. Excluded from context but retained for audit.

---

## Operational Terms

### Observe Mode

Continuous operation: watching Discord, storing messages, accumulating salience.

### Reflect Mode

Scheduled operation: running layers, generating insights, updating understanding.

### Polling

Periodic check of Discord channels for new messages.

### Model Profile

Named configuration mapping semantic task types to specific LLM models.

### Self-Concept Document

Markdown document (`data/self-concept.md`) containing Zos's synthesized self-understanding. Always included in context.
