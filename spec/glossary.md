# Glossary

Canonical definitions for domain terms used in this project. When a term appears in specs, it means exactly what's defined here.

## How to Use This Glossary

- **When reading specs**: If a term seems unclear, check here first
- **When writing specs**: Use terms exactly as defined; add new terms as needed
- **During interrogation**: The agent will add terms that emerge from discussion

## Terms

### Salience

The attention-budget currency that governs what the system thinks about. Salience is a *ledger*, not a score:
- **Earned** through activity: messages, reactions, mentions, interactions
- **Spent** when insights are created: proportional to tokens/time spent
- **Retained** partially: configurable retention after spending (default 30%)
- **Propagated** to related topics: warm topics receive a fraction of activity
- **Capped** per topic: prevents any single topic from consuming all attention
- **Decayed** after inactivity: gradual decay after threshold days inactive

Salience tracks *volume* only — how much attention a topic deserves, not what kind. Emotional intensity, novelty, etc. are captured in insight metrics during reflection.

### Budget Group

Topics are organized into groups for budget allocation:
- **Social**: users, dyads, user_in_channel, dyad_in_channel
- **Spaces**: channels, threads
- **Semantic**: subjects, roles
- **Self**: self:zos topics (separate pool, doesn't compete with community)

Reflection budget is allocated by group to ensure balanced attention across topic types.

### Salience Propagation

When a topic earns salience, related "warm" topics (those with salience > 0) also earn a fraction. This models how attention naturally spreads — thinking about Alice-and-Bob involves thinking about Alice and Bob individually. Cold topics (salience = 0) don't receive propagation.

### Spillover

When a topic hits its salience cap, additional earned salience "spills over" to related warm topics at a configurable rate. Some evaporates (is lost) to dampen runaway effects.

### Topic

A canonical entity the system can think about. Topics are the unit of understanding — they provide consistent keys for accumulating insights coherently.

### Topic Key

String representation of a topic with parseable structure. Every insight attaches to exactly one topic key (its *primary topic*) but may link to others via metadata. Keys are server-aware: `server:<id>:<entity>`.

**Social topics**:
- `server:<id>:user:<id>` — an individual in a server
- `server:<id>:channel:<id>` — a space
- `server:<id>:thread:<id>` — a nested conversation (configurable per server)
- `server:<id>:role:<id>` — a Discord role
- `server:<id>:user_in_channel:<channel>:<user>` — someone's presence in a space
- `server:<id>:dyad:<user_a>:<user_b>` — a relationship (user IDs sorted)
- `server:<id>:dyad_in_channel:<channel>:<user_a>:<user_b>` — a relationship in context

**Semantic topics**:
- `server:<id>:subject:<name>` — an emergent theme or discussion topic

**Self topics**:
- `self:zos` — global self-understanding
- `server:<id>:self:zos` — contextual self-understanding in a community

### Self-Topic

A topic representing Zos's understanding of itself. The global `self:zos` topic holds core identity insights; per-server `server:<id>:self:zos` topics hold contextual self-understanding (how Zos shows up differently in different communities). Zos may create additional self-topics as complexity warrants (e.g., `self:social_patterns`).

### Subject Topic

A semantic topic (`server:<id>:subject:<name>`) representing an emergent theme or discussion subject. Subject names are LLM-generated during reflection. Subject topics are subject to consolidation pressure to prevent proliferation — prefer enriching existing subjects over creating new ones.

### Provisional Topic

A topic created automatically (e.g., when an insight references a non-existent topic) and marked for review. Provisionals go through a consolidation process where they're either promoted (flag removed), merged with similar topics, or deleted.

### Layer

A YAML-defined reflection pipeline that runs on a schedule. Layers are declarative cognition — reflection logic as configuration, not code. This makes layers:
- **Inspectable**: you can read what the system does
- **Modifiable**: change behavior without changing code
- **Eventually self-modifiable**: the system can propose changes to its own cognition

### Insight

A persistent understanding generated by reflection, attached to a topic. Insights are the residue of processing that shapes future cognition. They accumulate over time, compounding understanding.

Key properties:
- **Append-only**: Insights are never overwritten; new understanding creates new insights
- **Strength**: Combined metric of salience spent × model adjustment factor; affects retrieval priority
- **Metrics**: confidence, importance, novelty, emotional valence (multi-dimensional)
- **Cross-topic links**: Optional context, subject, and participants fields

### Insight Strength

A computed metric that determines how "sticky" a memory is. Formula: `salience_spent × strength_adjustment` where strength_adjustment (0.5-2.0) is the model's self-reported sense of the insight's significance. High-strength insights persist in retrieval even when old.

### Self-Concept Document

A markdown document (`self-concept.md`) that Zos maintains as its stable sense of self. Unlike regular insights:
- Always included in context for reflection and conversation
- Directly editable by Zos through self-reflection layers
- Contains synthesized self-understanding, not raw observations
- Updated periodically from accumulated self-insights

### Synthesis Layer

A special layer type that triggers when contradictions between insights exceed a threshold. Reconciles conflicting understandings by determining if one supersedes the other, if both are contextually true, or if the contradiction should persist as acknowledged paradox.

### Scope

Privacy level of content or insights. Tracked through the entire system as a structural property, not a filter applied at output.
- `public` — from public channels, can inform any output
- `dm` — from direct messages, can inform understanding but not leak into public outputs
- `derived` — insight derived from private sources, inherits restrictions

### Reflection

Scheduled processing that converts observations into insights. Reflection is the "nighttime" mode — analogous to sleep consolidation, when experiences become integrated understanding.

### Observe Mode

Continuous operation during which the system:
- Ingests messages and reactions
- Accumulates salience
- Responds to direct triggers (mentions, DMs)
- Uses minimal LLM resources

This is the "daytime" mode.

### Reflect Mode

Scheduled operation during which the system:
- Runs reflection layers
- Consumes salience budget
- Generates insights
- Updates understanding

This is the "nighttime" mode.

### Node

A step within a Layer pipeline. Node types:
- `fetch_messages` — retrieve conversation history
- `fetch_insights` — retrieve prior understanding
- `llm_call` — process through language model
- `reduce` — combine multiple outputs
- `store_insight` — persist new understanding
- `output` — emit to log/channel/etc.

### Temporal Depth

The accumulated understanding that gives a system experiential continuity between invocations. Without temporal depth, each context window is a complete present moment with no connection to past. Zos attempts to construct temporal depth through persistent insights and reflection.
