# Glossary

Canonical definitions for domain terms used in this project. When a term appears in specs, it means exactly what's defined here.

---

## How to Use This Glossary

- **When reading specs**: If a term seems unclear, check here first
- **When writing specs**: Use terms exactly as defined; add new terms as needed
- **During interrogation**: The agent will add terms that emerge from discussion

## Terms

### Salience

The attention-budget currency that governs what the system thinks about. Salience is a *ledger*, not a score:
- **Earned** through activity: messages, reactions, mentions, interactions
- **Spent** during reflection: thinking about a topic costs salience
- **Retained** partially: configurable retention after reflection (0% = fresh each cycle, 30% = some persistence of priority)

Unbounded attention leads to either runaway compute or shallow analysis of everything. Salience budget forces prioritization — the system naturally thinks more about what matters more, as measured by actual community activity.

### Topic

A canonical entity the system can think about. Topics are the unit of understanding — they provide consistent keys for accumulating insights coherently.

### Topic Key

String representation of a topic with parseable structure. Every insight attaches to exactly one topic key. The taxonomy:
- `user:<id>` — an individual
- `channel:<id>` — a space
- `user_in_channel:<channel>:<user>` — someone's presence in a space
- `dyad:<user_a>:<user_b>` — a relationship (user IDs sorted for consistency)
- `dyad_in_channel:<channel>:<user_a>:<user_b>` — a relationship in context

### Layer

A YAML-defined reflection pipeline that runs on a schedule. Layers are declarative cognition — reflection logic as configuration, not code. This makes layers:
- **Inspectable**: you can read what the system does
- **Modifiable**: change behavior without changing code
- **Eventually self-modifiable**: the system can propose changes to its own cognition

### Insight

A persistent understanding generated by reflection, attached to a topic. Insights are the residue of processing that shapes future cognition. They accumulate over time, compounding understanding.

### Scope

Privacy level of content or insights. Tracked through the entire system as a structural property, not a filter applied at output.
- `public` — from public channels, can inform any output
- `dm` — from direct messages, can inform understanding but not leak into public outputs
- `derived` — insight derived from private sources, inherits restrictions

### Reflection

Scheduled processing that converts observations into insights. Reflection is the "nighttime" mode — analogous to sleep consolidation, when experiences become integrated understanding.

### Observe Mode

Continuous operation during which the system:
- Ingests messages and reactions
- Accumulates salience
- Responds to direct triggers (mentions, DMs)
- Uses minimal LLM resources

This is the "daytime" mode.

### Reflect Mode

Scheduled operation during which the system:
- Runs reflection layers
- Consumes salience budget
- Generates insights
- Updates understanding

This is the "nighttime" mode.

### Node

A step within a Layer pipeline. Node types:
- `fetch_messages` — retrieve conversation history
- `fetch_insights` — retrieve prior understanding
- `llm_call` — process through language model
- `reduce` — combine multiple outputs
- `store_insight` — persist new understanding
- `output` — emit to log/channel/etc.

### Temporal Depth

The accumulated understanding that gives a system experiential continuity between invocations. Without temporal depth, each context window is a complete present moment with no connection to past. Zos attempts to construct temporal depth through persistent insights and reflection.
